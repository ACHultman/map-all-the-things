# Map all the Things with Mapbox GL!

This repo contains source code and step-by-step instructions for a workshop entitled _Map all the Things with Mapbox GL!_  This was first presented as a <a href="https://candu.github.io/presentations/html/20200527-fwdjs-map-all-the-things">talk</a>at <a href="https://forwardjs.com/ottawa/schedule/">ForwardJS Ottawa 2020</a> to a virtual audience of roughly 700.  Given the high level of interest, I decided to submit it as a longer workshop for <a href="https://www.startupslam.io/2020">Startup Slam 2020</a>, and here we are!

## Session Description

Come learn how to map millions of features while keeping your visualizations understandable and navigable for your users!  In this session, we'll use Mapbox GL and open data from the City of Toronto to cover tools and techniques for mapping large datasets.  From Mapbox GL basics to vector tiles, heatmaps, and clustering, you'll learn several ways to harness the power of these datasets in your applications.

Although we'll focus on web-based applications, many of the same techniques can be used alongside Mapbox mobile SDKs to power map-based experiences on mobile.

## Session Requirements

You'll get more out of this session if you have some experience with frontend (HTML / CSS / JavaScript) development and are comfortable using npm or similar JavaScript package managers.  Previous experience with mapping and/or data visualization also helps, but is not required.  Slides and materials will be available after the workshop as well, so you'll be able to refer back to them anytime.
